**Daprian Client - An Innovative Minecraft Utility**

> **Introducing the Concept of a "Free-Style" Client:**

We have conceived a client that places a strong emphasis on efficiency and continuous updates, ensuring that it remains up-to-date at all times. Our approach involves embracing the concept of a free-style client, which means harnessing publicly available code to provide our users with the best possible experience, all with the consent of the community. Importantly, our client is entirely free of charge and unobfuscated. We are staunch proponents of transparency, making all information regarding the use of non-proprietary code publicly accessible here.

Developers' Note:
As explained earlier, you might wonder, "Is everything copied/pasted?" The unequivocal answer is no! We are unwavering in our commitment to the belief that crafting a genuinely unique client goes beyond mere duplication. The core foundation of this client is exclusively our own. For new developers, we do not permit any alterations to the fundamental structure or the primary user experience of the client from external sources. Rest assured, every change is meticulously overseen by me (Daprian), and any deviations will be promptly rectified.
